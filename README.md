Uncovering the temporal dynamics and regulatory networks of thermal
stress response in a hyperthermophile using transcriptomics and
proteomics
================


This repository contains bioinformatic analysis of the manuscript titled
**Uncovering the temporal dynamics and regulatory networks of thermal
stress response in a hyperthermophile using transcriptomics and
proteomics**.

You can find the preprint here:
<https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.02.539125>

This document provides a general workflow and overview of the tools we
have for analysis, including:  
- Differential gene expression using `DESeq2`  
- Differential protein expression using `limma`  
- Identification of transcript 3â€™ ends - Analysis of operons using
Nanopore PCR-cDNA sequencing  
- Downstream analysis, including arCOG enrichment & cluster analysis
